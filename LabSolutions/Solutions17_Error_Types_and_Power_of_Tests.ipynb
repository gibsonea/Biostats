The power of a test tells us how likely it is that a statistically significant difference will be detected based on a finite sample size n, if the alternative hypothesis is true (i.e., if $\\mu = \\mu_{1}$) that is, if the true mean $\\mu$ differs from the mean under the null hypothesis ($\\mu_{0}$). If the power is too low, then there is little chance of finding a significant difference and nonsignificant results are likely even if real differences exist between the true mean $\\mu$ of the group being studied and the null mean $\\mu_{0}$. An inadequate sample size is usually the cause of low power to detect a scientifically meaningful difference.\n"
